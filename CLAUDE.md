# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a KPI CLI application for managing staff performance indicators, designed to be API-ready for future development. The system allows:

- **KPI Management**: Create KPIs with names, descriptions, calculation formulas, raw data requirements, target values, and scoring criteria (1-5 points)
- **Staff Organization**: Staff can be grouped by departments
- **Weight Assignment**: Each KPI can have configurable weights
- **Quarterly Tracking**: Monitor performance on a quarterly basis
- **Reporting**: Generate quarterly and annual summary reports with scores

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM (TypeScript-first, migration-ready)
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js with inquirer for interactive prompts
- **API Framework**: Fastify with comprehensive plugins for production-ready API
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation and type safety
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, bcrypt password hashing
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, nodemon for hot reload

## Database Schema (SQLite)

### Core Tables
- **users**: id, email, password_hash, name, role, staff_id, active, timestamps (API authentication)
- **departments**: id, name, description, timestamps
- **staff**: id, employee_id, name, email, department_id, position, hire_date, active, timestamps
- **kpis**: id, name, description, formula_json, raw_data_schema_json, target_value, scoring_criteria_json, weight, active, timestamps
- **staff_kpis**: Many-to-many relationship between staff and KPIs
- **raw_data_entries**: Stores raw data for KPI calculations by period
- **evaluations**: Calculated KPI results and scores
- **evaluation_summaries**: Aggregated quarterly/annual performance summaries

## Key Design Patterns

### Service Layer Pattern
All business logic is implemented in the service layer (`src/core/services/`), making it immediately reusable for future API development. CLI commands are thin wrappers around service calls.

### Domain-Driven Design
- Models represent core business entities
- Services handle business operations and validation
- Utilities handle technical concerns (formulas, scoring)

### Data Storage Strategy
- Complex data (formulas, scoring criteria, raw data) stored as JSON columns for flexibility
- Quarterly periods indexed as year/quarter combinations for efficient querying
- Soft deletes using active flags to maintain data integrity

## Formula System

KPI formulas are stored as JSON and can reference raw data fields. The formula engine supports:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Mathematical functions (sum, average, min, max)
- Conditional logic for complex calculations
- Variable substitution from raw data

## Scoring System

Scoring criteria define how calculated KPI values map to 1-5 point scores:
```json
{
  "ranges": [
    {"min": 0, "max": 50, "score": 1},
    {"min": 51, "max": 70, "score": 2},
    {"min": 71, "max": 85, "score": 3},
    {"min": 86, "max": 95, "score": 4},
    {"min": 96, "max": 100, "score": 5}
  ]
}
```
